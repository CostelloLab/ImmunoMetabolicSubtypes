#### This is a program for calculating the spearman correlations between cytokine and metabolite abundances.

### load the libraries

```{r}
### load the libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(psych)
```

### load the data

```{r}
load("~/OneDrive - The University of Colorado Denver/Projects/ImmunoMetabolicSubtypes/data/processed/T21_mixed_cyt_met.RData")
load("~/OneDrive - The University of Colorado Denver/Projects/ImmunoMetabolicSubtypes/data/processed/D21_mixed_cyt_met.RData")

```


### Calculated the correlations within Cytokines

``` r
T21_cytokine_correlations <- T21.mixed$cytokines %>%
    corr.test(method = "spearman", adjust = "fdr")

D21_cytokine_correlations <- D21.mixed$cytokines %>%
    corr.test(method = "spearman", adjust = "fdr")

```

### Calculated the correlations within Metabolites

``` r
T21_metabolite_correlations <- T21.mixed$metabolites %>%
    corr.test(method = "spearman", adjust = "fdr")

D21_metabolite_correlations <- D21.mixed$metabolites %>%
    corr.test(method = "spearman", adjust = "fdr")

```
