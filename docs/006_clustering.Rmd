## Steps in clustering as defined by Milligan(1996)

1. Selection of objects and variables - overlap of cyt, met, RNA data (001)
2. Decisions concerning variable normalization - adjustment for age, sex, and sample_source, standardized (001)
3. Selection of a distance measure - NEMO (nemo_functions.R)
4. Selection of a clustering method - spectral clustering (nemo_functions.R)
5. Determining the numebr of clusters - (cluster_comparison.R)
6. Validating the clusters - 
7. Descibing and profiling the clusters - 


## Metrics for determining the number of clusters
1. Eigengap
	* 
2. Robust Clust
   *
3. Davies-Bouldin
   * Lower index values indicate a better clustering result. The index is improved (lowered) by increased separation between clusters and decreased variation within clusters.
4. Calinksi-Harabasz
   * A higher value of CH indicates a better clustering, because it means that the data points are more spread out between clusters than they are within clusters.

## Determining the number of clusters based on the number of overlaps between two co-occurring conditions


An  approach may consider that we are interested in finding axes of disease co-occurance among the data. Therefore, we will restrict our number of neighbors to the mean number of neighbors. 

```r
diff_sig_threshold = .1
clinical_threshold = .1
omics.list = list(t(T21.mixed$cytokines),t(T21.mixed$metabolites))
NUMC <- 2:8
phenotypes =  names(T21.mixed$clinic)[c(2,6,9:21)]

overlap <- sapply(phenotypes[3:length(phenotypes)], function(x) {
    sapply(phenotypes[3:length(phenotypes)], function(y) {
        tmp <- table(T21.mixed$clinic[[x]],T21.mixed$clinic[[y]])
        return(tmp["1","1"])
    })})

num_neighbors = floor(mean(overlap[upper.tri(overlap)]))

res <- clusterEval(omics.list = list(t(T21.mixed$cytokines),t(T21.mixed$metabolites)),
                clinic = T21.mixed$clinic,
                phenotypes = phenotypes,
                NUMC = NUMC,  
                diff_sig_threshold = diff_sig_threshold,
                clinical_threshold = clinical_threshold,
                num_neighbors = num_neighbors)

res$summary
res$eigengap
res$nemo

W <- nemo.affinity.graph(raw.data = omics.list, num.clusters = 5, k = num_neighbors)
clustering <- spectralClustering(W, K = 5)

```

## Perform the clustering

                NUMC = NUMC,  
                diff_sig_threshold = diff_sig_threshold,
                clinical_threshold = clinical_threshold,

## How stable are the clusters over the number of neighbors?

```r
num_neighbors_grid <- seq(10,25,1)

multi_omic_res = lapply(num_neighbors_grid, function(x) {
    print(x)
    clusterEval(omics.list = list(t(T21.mixed$cytokines),t(T21.mixed$metabolites)),
                clinic = T21.mixed$clinic,
                phenotypes = phenotypes,
                iterations = iterations,
                NUMC = NUMC,  
                diff_sig_threshold = diff_sig_threshold,
                clinical_threshold = clinical_threshold,
                num_neighbors = x)
})

names(multi_omic_res) <- num_neighbors_grid

enriched_conditions <- sapply(multi_omic_res, function(x) x$summary$`# of enriched conditions`)
enriched_conditions <- as.data.frame(enriched_conditions)
enriched_conditions$clusters <- NUMC

enriched_conditions <- enriched_conditions %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = -clusters)

ggplot(enriched_conditions, aes(x = clusters, y = value, color = as.factor(name))) +
    geom_line() +
    theme_classic()

lapply(multi_omic_res[1:4], function(x) x$summary)
lapply(multi_omic_res[1:4], function(x) x$eigen)
lapply(multi_omic_res[1:4], function(x) x$nemo)

```
