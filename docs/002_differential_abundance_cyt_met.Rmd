# Differential Abundance analysis of cytokines and metabolites
This program executes the differential abundance analysis of cytokines and metabolites using helper scripts from data_prep_functions.R located in ./R


### load libraries and scripts
```r
source("~/OneDrive - The University of Colorado Denver/Projects/ImmunoMetabolicSubtypes/R/data_prep_functions.R")
```


### load the data
```r
load("~/OneDrive - The University of Colorado Denver/Projects/ImmunoMetabolicSubtypes/data/processed/all_cyt_met_standardized.RData")

```

### Cytokines

```r
cyt_diff <- diff_expr_wrapper(all_standardized$cytokines, all_standardized$clinic, "Karyotype", "Control", test = "wilcoxon")
    
```
