```


Following the same procedure as document 006 for T21 individuals

```r
diff_sig_threshold = .1
clinical_threshold = .2
omics.list = list(t(D21.mixed$cytokines),t(D21.mixed$metabolites))
NUMC <- 2:6
phenotypes =  names(D21.mixed$clinic)[c(2,6,9:21)]
iterations = 1000
num_neighbors = 25

```

``` r
source("~/OneDrive - The University of Colorado Denver/Projects/ImmunoMetabolicSubtypes/R/cluster_evaluation.R")
res <- clusterEval(omics.list = list(t(D21.mixed$cytokines),t(D21.mixed$metabolites)),
                clinic = D21.mixed$clinic,
                phenotypes = phenotypes,
                NUMC = NUMC,  
                diff_sig_threshold = diff_sig_threshold,
                clinical_threshold = clinical_threshold,
                num_neighbors = num_neighbors,
                iterations = iterations)
res$summary
res$eigengap
res$nemo

write_csv(x = res$summary,file = "~/OneDrive - The University of Colorado Denver/Projects/ImmunoMetabolicSubtypes/results/tables/D21_cyt_met_clustering_results.csv")

```

## Perform the clustering

```r
D21_all_clust <- nemo.clustering(omics.list = list(t(D21.mixed$cytokines),t(D21.mixed$metabolites)),num.clusters = 2,num.neighbors = num_neighbors)
save(D21_all_clust, file ="~/OneDrive - The University of Colorado Denver/Projects/ImmunoMetabolicSubtypes/results/clusterings/D21_all_clust.RData")

```
